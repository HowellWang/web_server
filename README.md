# web_server

Project Description:
Users can use command make to compile our code because of "Makefile" file .

It may show that using deprecated API, please just ignore it because I use SSLContext and KeyManagerFactory in my code.

When users want to use our program, they only need type following:

"java WebServer --serverPort=http_port --sslServerPort=https_port".

This program can provide http service and https service simultaneously.
